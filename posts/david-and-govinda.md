It was in October of 2024 that I first met David. The monsoon hadn't quite passed yet, and the last few showers of the season were beating down on Mysore that week. On such a rainy day, I found myself at Govinda's, a tiny yogic cafe in the heart of Gokulam. My habit of spending evenings holed up at cafes was still a new one, and Govinda's was my preferred haunt at the time. At 4 or so, I'd walk in, have a chat with Raju, the proprietor, make myself comfortable, and order a cup of herbal tea for myself.

There wasn't much to the interior of the cafe, the whole place was the size of a small bedroom with four low tables arranged near each corner. Either side of each table were two thick mattresses for seating. Were you to spend more than ten or fifteen minutes there (which I often did), you could prop yourself up against the wall with two pillows for cushioning. 

The food at the cafe was rather unremarkable and bland, and a warm brew was perfect for the weather. And so I'd spend the next few hours staring into the laptop screen, pausing every ten minutes or so to sip my tea, look out onto the street, and scribble something down on my notebook. On one such pause, my eyes caught sight of a man entering the gate past the verandah. Visitors had been few and far in between that day, and so the latest one caught my attention for a moment. He took a seat by Raju's room, and called out for him. The man had a dull orange beard, very large eyes and a frenzied look to him. Raju soon joined him on the chair opposite with two cups of tea and they began talking. I sunk back into my screen, but found myself constantly glancing over at them. The man seemed to be narrating a story, which by the enthralled look on Raju's face, seemed quite interesting.
